    "Raw strings are often used in Regex objects to avoid unwanted interpretation of escape characters. In Python, backslashes () have a special meaning in string literals as they are used to represent escape sequences. However, in regular expressions, backslashes are frequently used as part of the pattern syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "By using a raw string in a Regex object, denoted by the 'r' prefix, backslashes are treated as literal characters rather than escape characters. This allows you to write regular expressions without having to double-escape backslashes. It simplifies the readability and avoids potential errors caused by misinterpretation of backslashes.\n",

If a non-raw string were used, it would be written as '\\(\\d)', with each backslash being escaped.
